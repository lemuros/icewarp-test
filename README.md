# IceWarp test

This is a simple application developed as a solution for the IceWarp test. Details about assignment can be found [here](./Assignment.pdf).

## Dialog features

- Dialog components are split into multiple files, located in /src/components/dialog.
- The dialog window supports multiple sizes.
- The dialog can be closed by pressing the Esc key.
- The application includes several example dialogs.
- The dialog supports basic responsiveness.

## Shortcomings

This section outlines the shortcomings that need to be addressed before the Dialog component can be used in a production environment. 

- Dialog buttons should support advanced responsiveness, automatically hiding (partially or fully) within the popper component when they donâ€™t fit the container.
- The styling of the Dialog component and its subcomponents needs to be refined.
- E2E tests should be implemented to ensure full functionality.
- Improved documentation and usage guidelines need to be written.
